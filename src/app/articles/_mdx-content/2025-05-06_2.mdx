# UNHCR Response
The UNHCR is an organization that's been helping those in 
need in Afghanistan for over 35 years. UNHCR teams 
immediately started distributing emergency relief items, 
like soap, blankets, underpants, solar lamps, jerry cans, 
napkins, buckets, gas cookers, kitchen sets, family tents, 
plastic tarps, and heaters. All of the mentioned items are 
needed for various reasons, keeping warm, sanitary, or 
keeping from the weather, there are many reasons. 

Cash assistance also helps families greatly, many families 
need money and are usually forced to do many things that they 
wouldn't want to do, but with cash assistance they don't have 
to result to such measures. Over 876 families have been provided 
with cash assistance from the UNHCR. The UNHCR also provides 
psychological support to those who need it. They also provide 
protection to women and children and those with disabilities. 

# UNFPA Response
The UNFPA specifically supports women and children, mainly 
pregnant women and women with children. 7000 pregnant women needed 
attention immediately when the earthquakes struck, mainly those who 
were going to deliver a baby soon. When the UNFPA arrived, they helped 
mothers and their children, helped deliver premature babies and helped 
with counseling as well. Conseling was important because some mothers 
felt bad for having a baby in a time of crisis, thinking about how a baby 
shouldn't be in a crisis, and then there were the mothers who lost their 
children in the initial earthquakes, and that's why they provide counseling 
as well. There were also mothers who couldn't deliver their baby properly 
because they weren't able to get to a hospital, and some babies ended up 
dying because of that.
