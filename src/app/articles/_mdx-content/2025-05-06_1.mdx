# The Impact Report
Herat was hit with powerful earthquakes 
on October 7th and October 11th. More than 
275,000 people were affected by the earthquakes, 
48,000 households were destroyed or damaged, 
21,300 public buildings were damaged, and more 
than 37,000 families were made to live in 
makeshift shelters. 

## OCHA Flash Update
This is a summarization of the initial report that was 
made on the very day of the earthquake, this is specifically 
only about the first earthquake that hit on October 7th.

On October 7th, 2023, Herat was hit with a 6.3 magnitude 
earthquake, and around 100 people died and 500 were injured, 
465 houses were reported to be damaged and 135 were damaged. 
It was estimated that around 600 families were affected, and 300 
families were displaced to Herat where they would live in 
abandoned buildings. 

As partners and local authorities searched, they anticipated 
that they would find more casualties and find those trapped 
under collapsed buildings. In response to the earthquake, humanitarian 
partners started their relief efforts, sending medical and trauma support 
to the regional hospitals, and sending in emergency supplies like tents 
and temporary shelter. Their priority was to send in emergency food, 
emergency medical supplies, and hygiene kits. 

The humanitarian partners that helped for the 
initial response was Afghanistan National Disaster 
Management Authority (ANDMA), the Department of Refugees 
and Repatriation (DoRR), the Herat Provincial Governor, and 
then the five emergency assessment teams deployed by IOM, DRC, 
WFP-RRAA, ARRA, IRC and HELP Germany. IOM and UNHCR would give 
emergency tents and supplies, WFP gave out high energy biscuits, 
UNFPA handed out dignity kits, and UNICEF deployed an emergency 
WASH response which is Water supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene. 
The Red Cross and Red Crescent also deployed response teams. 

OCHA coordinated the emergency response, they held meetings 
to determine the situation and made a map to see the capacity of 
what their partners were capable of. They also held another meeting to 
determine a wider response and work on recovery efforts.

When the earthquake hit, the T###### estimated that at least 4000 people died, 
but the U.N estimated that it was more around 1500 people, but the survivors 
stopped counting how many people died since they were too busy digging up 
their loved ones from the rubble. This was also a big challenge for the 
T###### since they faced many hardships before, and this earthquake was 
testing them to see if they can lead a country. 

The T###### did initially help the survivors and the transportation of 
patients and corpses, and they even gave free water and food to the 
survivors. The T###### did help for several months, but then they 
eventually stopped. Foreign aid eventually had to step in to come help 
the survivors and refuges, but it was hard because there isn't a lot of 
support because of other crises throughout the world, and because of how the 
T###### treat the women and girls isn't helping with the support. 

The reason why the T###### helped the refugees and survivors in the first 
place was because they were trying to become recognized as an actual 
government, and these earthquakes was a way for them to prove that they 
could run a government. But the U.N. will not recognize them as a government 
because they won't allow women to get education or employment.
